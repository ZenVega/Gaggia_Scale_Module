# Gaggia Scale Module
A precision scale integration for Gaggia espresso machines, solving the common problem of limited space between the portafilter and drip tray.
## üéØ Project Overview
This project was inspired by the excellent Gaggiuino Project, but focuses specifically on integrating a precision scale directly into the machine base. The built-in scale eliminates the need for external scales and maximizes the limited space in compact espresso machine setups.

## üîß Hardware Components

 - Load Cells: Precision weight sensors mounted beneath the drip tray
 - Arduino Nano: Main microcontroller for processing and control
 - 2x 750g loadcells
 - 2x HX711 Amplifier Boards: Signal amplification for load cell data
 - Rotary Encoder with Push Button: User interface for target weight setting and tare function
 - 240VAC -> 12vDC transformator
 - AC relay to bypass the brew switch
 - PushButton

further components are
 - 3D Printed Mount: Custom load cell mounting system (files adapted from Gaggiuino project)
 - 3D Printed / Laser cut terminal
